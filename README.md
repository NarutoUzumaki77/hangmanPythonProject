# hangmanPythonProject
Typical Hang man game designed in python, using Tkinter library

If the player guesses a letter that occurs in the word, it is entered in to its position,
however if the guessed letter does not occur in the word, the game draws some element
of a hang man figure as a tally mark. If the player continues to get his guesses wrong
until the figure of the hangman is completely drawn on the screen, then the player has
lost the game. If the player guesses all the missing letters of the word right then player
wins the game.
